This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components mount before data is fully loaded.

```javascript
// buggy code
<Text>{this.state.userData.name}</Text>
```

Here, if `this.state.userData` is null or undefined before the component renders, accessing `.name` will throw a TypeError.  The same issue occurs with array indexing if you attempt to access an index which does not exist.
